# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
KPMGâ€™s Analytics, Information &amp; Modelling group helps organizations take the mystery out of big data and show them how to leverage their data resources to produce better business outcomes.  
Our approach is based on the proposition that business success depends on what you actually do with your business information, not how much of it you control and collate. 
With our information-driven approach, we can give your organisation a holistic view of your data, enabling you to learn from and use it to make better business decisions, grow revenue, enhance operational capabilities, and manage enterprise risks and compliance mandates. 
Task 1 - Data Quality Assesment
